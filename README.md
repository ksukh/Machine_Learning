# Machine Learning
Machine Learning projects I worked on including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 
1. K-means clustering - model predicts the quality of customers at a Jewerly Store given their demographics such as age, income level, spending score & savings.
2. Purchase preditction - classfication model predicts a customer's possibility on purchasing Citrus Hill vs Minute Maid orange juice. 

Also contains summary document on various performance metrics that can be used based on problem at hand.
